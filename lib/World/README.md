## Introduction of WORLD family (2016/05/26)

I introduce useful software in WORLD. If you want to introduce your project in WORLD, please contact me.

PyWorldVocoder (https://github.com/JeremyCCHsu/Python-Wrapper-for-World-Vocoder) is a Python wrapper for World Vocoder.

Note: To avoid making the project complicated, I decided not to merge it to my repository and introduce your project here. The other reason is that I can't support some computer languages.
